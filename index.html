     <h4>Appearances</h4>
     <div>
     	<p>Over the years, Nagato has made many appearances throughout tv. She first appeared as a supporting character in "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as the quiet girl from the literary club who willingly chose to take part as a member of the SOS Brigade. She is voiced by Minori Chihara in Japan and Michelle Ruff in the U.S.</p>
        <p>After TMOHS, she starred alongside the Brigade again in the second season of Haruhi Suzumiya as well as "The Adventures of Haruhi-Chan and would later go on to get her own spinoff in the manga series "The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan."</p>
        <p>Of course, being a humanoid interface is not without its perks. Nagato has displayed superhuman strength, agility, and stamina and appears to be immune to pain. She also has sensory powers and mental abilities like playing the guitar without ever practicing as well as data powers that come with being a humanoid interface.</p>
